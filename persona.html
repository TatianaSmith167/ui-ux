    Site: Temu
    Persona: Angela

    Tech: Angela has an iPhone, and not really much else. She's an average tech user.

    Love/Hate: Angela loves endlessly scrolling through social media and sites like Amazon and Temu.  She hates when a new app freezes and when it starts acting buggy when she's been on it for a while.

    Proficiency: Angela is an average user, so she knows how to do the basics such as going into her settings, launching apps, downloading apps, deleting apps, and following simple in-app navigation.
